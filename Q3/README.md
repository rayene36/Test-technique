## Question 3 (RESTful API)

Design a RESTful API for the following situation. Make sure to include all relevant information (verb, path, query parameters, request body, response code, response headers, response body). The table is provided as an example, you can write your answers in a different format if you prefer. For the purpose of this test, do not add specifications for the possible errors. Use JSON for the body format.

We want to manage customers for a business. Customers have basic properties : name and email. They also have subscriptions to paid plans. They can opt out of plans.

Here are the scenarios we would like implemented for the first step : 

* Create a new customer.
* List one customer
* Unsubscribe a customer from a plan.
