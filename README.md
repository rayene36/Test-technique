# README #

This repository is the technical test for a developer. 


## Before the test

1. Clone this repository.
2. Checkout the branch that was given to you or create one from master with your name


## Test
Important: Questions are often written in java syntax, but this does not mean you need to use Java. Use any object oriented language you want, even pseudo-code.

Each question is in its folder. Please answer directly in the README unless specified otherwise. 

You can use everything you want, including internet. 

## After the test

Once all questions are answered, commit your modifications using a significant commit message.

Your test will be reviewed later on a Pull Request.
